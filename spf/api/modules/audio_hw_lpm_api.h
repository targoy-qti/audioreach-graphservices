/* When LPM resources are successfully allocated and requested:
    - The status field indicates a success
    - The message payload contains the LPM resources response payload
    - Data in the payload contains the physical address (lower 32 bits and higher 32 bits) of the LPM that was allocated by
      the aDSP.

    For example, if 4 KB of LPM was requested and it is
    successfully allocated, the data in the payload contains a valid physical address.

    If requested resources were not allocated successfully, the payload is
    invalid. */
