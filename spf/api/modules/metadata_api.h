/**
 * Metadata API to support the requirement of exchanging the metadata between the client and SPF
 *
 *   Metadata in general can be defined as additional information associated with the stream data.
 *
 *   Application or usage of the metadata information would be defined based on the type of
 *   Metadata which would be specified by the metadata ID
 *
 *   The metadata is expected to be exchanged in the specified format for writing and reading both
 *   by the HLOS client and the SPF during the data command read/write operations.
 *
 *   In general all the metadata is applicable to all the channels in the stream data
 *
 *  Defining metadata association
 *     Sample associated: Metadata is applicable at the offset at which it's inserted.
 *                        This metadata suffers both algorithmic and buffering delays.
 *     Buffer associated: metadata is applicable at the offset for the buffer.
 *                        This metadata suffers buffering delays only.
 *
 *  Defining metadata flag : The flags in the metadata payload specifies various control information.
 *  More details of individual controls are defined in the payload.
