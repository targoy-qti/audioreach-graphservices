                 offset is from the base address, which is defined as the
                 address given by apm_shared_map_region_payload_t.

        After mapping a physical region using this command, a mem_map_handle is
        returned. Subsequently, the client uses mem_map_handle in any command
        using addresses or offsets that belong to a memory region mapped in
        this command.

        @contcell
        @subhead{Bit 3 -- is\_client\_loaned\_memory flag}

        Specifies whether the client manages the memory or allows the APM to
        manage the memory:
          - 0 -- Client owned memory (the shared memory is managed by the
                 client). @vertspace{3}
          - 1 -- Client loaned memory (the shared memory is mapped by the
                 client and managed by the APM).

        For loaned memory, the client must relinquish the memory access
        permissions for multi-DSP framework (MDF) use cases.

        @contcell
        @subhead{Bit 4-5 -- loaned\_memory\_heap\_configuration}

        Specifies the heap configuration for the memory loaned by client and
        managed by APM ( .i.e., this configuration is valid only when Bit_3 is SET)
          - 0 -- Default Heap ( Regular heap, functionally backward compatible )
          - 1 -- Safe Heap    ( When the satellite is considered as un-secure
                                Process Domain, configuring as Safe Heap is
                                recommended )

         -It is recommended to use the same heap configuration for all the MDF memory maps

         with same loaned shared memory mapped to all the satellite PD's,
         and one of the satellite PD is termed as un-secure PD,
         configuring as Safe Heap is recommended.
         -In general, configuration as Default Heap is recommended.

        @contcell
        @subhead{Bit 6-8 -- memory\_address\_type}

         Specifies the memory address type. In the Default configuration (0), would ensure backward compatibility.
           -  0     – Physical/Virtual Address
           -  1     – File descriptor
           -  2-7   – Values reserved for Future

		 It is important to note, the Signal Processing Framework (a.k.a AudioReach SPF)  would not have any
		 mechanism to convert the memory address type or validate the same.
         This configuration would enable the HLOS system, specifically GSL in userspace and the audio packet
         driver with kernel space access, to determine if FD (file descriptor) to PA (physical address)
         conversion is required in the audio packet driver. This determination is based on the actual needs
         of the underlying process domain, which requires memory addresses accordingly.

           -  2-7   – Values reserved for Future

		 It is important to note, the Signal Processing Framework (a.k.a AudioReach SPF)  would not have any
		 mechanism to convert the memory address type or validate the same.
         This configuration would enable the HLOS system, specifically GSL in userspace and the audio packet
         driver with kernel space access, to determine if FD (file descriptor) to PA (physical address)
         conversion is required in the audio packet driver. This determination is based on the actual needs
         of the underlying process domain, which requires memory addresses accordingly.
